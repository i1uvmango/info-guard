# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST

## Context
I need you to implement [FEATURE_NAME] according to the detailed specification for the Info-Guard project.

## Required Reading
Please review these documents before starting:
- `docs/features/feature-XXX-[name].md` - Detailed feature specification
- `docs/04-tools-and-setup.md` - Tool usage guidelines
- `docs/05-coding-standards.md` - Coding standards
- `docs/02-architecture.md` - System architecture overview

## Implementation Steps
1. **Plan Review**: Confirm you understand the requirements
2. **Test Design**: Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
3. **Implementation**: Write minimum code to pass tests
4. **Validation**: Ensure all safety checks pass
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs
