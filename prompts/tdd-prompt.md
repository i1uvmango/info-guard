# TDD IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST

## Context
I need you to implement [FEATURE_NAME] using Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for the Info-Guard project.

## TDD Workflow
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Write minimum code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green

## Required Reading
Please review these documents before starting:
- `docs/features/feature-XXX-[name].md` - Detailed feature specification
- `docs/04-tools-and-setup.md` - Tool usage guidelines
- `docs/05-coding-standards.md` - Coding standards

## Implementation Steps
1. **Test Planning**: Design test cases covering:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases and error conditions
   - AI model accuracy validation
   - Data privacy requirements
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Write Failing Tests**: Create comprehensive test suite including:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for AI pipeline
   - API endpoint tests
   - Chrome extension functionality tests
   - Data validation tests

3. **Implement Minimum Code**: Write only the code needed to make tests pass

4. **Refactor**: Clean up code while maintaining:
   - All tests still pass
   - Code readability
   - Performance requirements
   - Security standards

## Test Categories for Info-Guard
- **Content Analysis Tests**: Verify AI models correctly analyze video content
- **Credibility Scoring Tests**: Ensure scoring algorithm is accurate and fair
- **Bias Detection Tests**: Validate bias detection without introducing new biases
- **API Integration Tests**: Test YouTube API and external fact-checking APIs
- **Chrome Extension Tests**: Verify extension functionality and UI
- **Privacy Tests**: Ensure user data protection
- **Performance Tests**: Validate real-time analysis capabilities

## Safety Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting rules satisfied
- [ ] Type checking clean
- [ ] No console errors/warnings
- [ ] Follows established patterns
- [ ] AI model outputs are explainable
- [ ] Privacy requirements met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved

## Questions to Ask
- Are there any unclear requirements about the AI analysis?
- Do you need additional context about existing AI models?
- Are there any potential edge cases in content analysis?
- What are the performance requirements for real-time analysis?
